# Efficient-City-Route-Planner
An AI powered city route planner utilizing the A* algorithm. It provides an efficient  solution for finding the shortest path between two points in a city. 

# Overview
This is a visual studio code utilizes python and the Tkinter library.
It serves as a practical demonstration of AI techniques applied to transportation logistics, particularly useful for optimizing commuting and urban planning.
This project showcases algorithmic proficiency and real-world problem-solving skills.

# Technologies used
python, visual studio, tkinter, Ucs.

# Usage
To clone this repository first you have to install jupytor notebook if in case it is not available then use visual studio with python pakages and libraries(matplotlib, tkinter) intalled
execute the code with CheckGUI.py and visualize the results

# Future Work
The City Route project could explore several avenues to enhance its functionality and user experience. This includes integrating machine learning techniques to predict and optimize routes based on historical traffic data, advancing heuristic functions to improve the efficiency of the A* algorithm, and developing interactive visualization features for real-time traffic updates.
